The error `Resource not accessible by integration` typically occurs when the GitHub Actions workflow is trying to access a resource or perform an action that requires specific permissions or access tokens. In this case, the issue seems to involve the `actions/create-release@v1` or `actions/upload-release-asset@v1` steps, which rely on the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret.

### Likely Cause

1. **GITHUB_TOKEN Permissions**: The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` might not have sufficient permissions to create releases or upload assets.
2. **Secrets Missing or Incorrect**: The secrets `EXTENSION_ID` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` may not be properly configured or accessible.
3. **Triggering Context**: If the workflow was triggered by a fork or a pull request, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` may have limited permissions for security reasons.

### Solution

1. **Update Workflow Permissions**
   Ensure that the workflow has the necessary permissions to create releases. You can explicitly set this in the workflow file:

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: write
   ```

   Add this at the top of your workflow file, just below the `on:` section.

2. **Check Secrets Configuration**
   Verify that the necessary secrets (`EXTENSION_ID` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`) are properly configured:

   - Go to the repository settings → Secrets and variables → Actions secrets.
   - Ensure `EXTENSION_ID` is correctly set.
   - The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub, but custom tokens (if used) should have the `repo` scope.

3. **Fork Trigger Issue**
   If this workflow runs on a forked repository, the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` may not have sufficient permissions. Consider running the workflow only on the main repository:

   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       tags:
         - 'v*'
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main
   ```

4. **Alternative Token Usage**
   If the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is insufficient, use a personal access token (PAT) with the `repo` scope:
   - Create a PAT from your GitHub account.
   - Add it as a secret in the repository (e.g., `PAT_TOKEN`).
   - Update the `env` sections:
     ```yaml
     env:
       GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
     ```

### Updated Workflow File

Here is the updated workflow file with the permissions fix and PAT usage:

```yaml
name: Release Extension

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Create extension package
        run: |
          zip -r extension.zip . \
          -x "*.git*" \
          -x "*.github*" \
          -x "node_modules/*" \
          -x "docs/*" \
          -x "*.md"

      - name: Generate updates.xml
        run: |
          VERSION=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/v}

            </app>
          </gupdate>
          EOF
        env:
          EXTENSION_ID: ${{ secrets.EXTENSION_ID }}

      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:

          prerelease: false

      - name: Upload Extension Package
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
          asset_path: ./extension.zip
          asset_name: extension.zip
          asset_content_type: application/zip

      - name: Upload updates.xml
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
          asset_path: ./updates.xml
